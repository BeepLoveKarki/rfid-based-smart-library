As soon as any student enters the library, he connects to the raspberry pi hotspot via his android or laptop and logs in via his username and password.

Since the website contains various features, we discuss them below:

a) Book requests and responses

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student uses this feature if any book he is searching for is not found in the library!!! He sends a request to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;library admin (who uses the admin panel) for the book!!! As soon as the book arrives he receives the notification of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrival!!! The live hosting of this site, makes it easier for him to know book arrival via home!!!
